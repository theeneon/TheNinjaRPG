# AGENTS.md

Repository-wide agent instructions; `CLAUDE.md` imports this file. Paths below are relative to the repository root.

## Required invariants

- Run all `make` commands from the repository/worktree root, never `app/`. Run `make build` **only when explicitly requested**.
- **Combat:** `initiateBattle()` must preload everything combat needs into battle state. `performAction()` gets ONE initial battle-state query, in-memory processing, then ONE `Promise.all` mutation phase. **Never add intermediate fetches**; add missing data at initiation.
- **Economy:** use atomic WHERE/CAS guards for balances, receipt delivery and reward claims; check `rowsAffected` before granting irreversible rewards. Use SQL increments for counters vulnerable to stale snapshots.
- **Database latency:** fetch independent queries upfront with `Promise.all()`, then filter in JavaScript. Prefer fewer round-trips over smaller payloads. Defer a query only when it depends on an earlier result, or is expensive and potentially unnecessary.
- Define all Zod schemas in `app/src/validators/`, never inline in pages or routers.
- When refactoring schema, remove deprecated fields and migrate all callers; do not retain legacy fields. Run `make makemigrations` after editing `app/drizzle/schema.ts`.
- React hooks must run unconditionally, in stable order, before early returns. Use query `enabled` for conditional fetching and react-hook-form `useWatch`, never `watch` (React Compiler). Verify hook ordering after frontend changes.
- Before filtering a Sentry error, verify meaningful user feedback, resolved loading states and no broken/blank UI. Comment how UX is handled; use domain-validating regexes for URL filters, never substring matching.

## Repository consistency

- Before implementing, inspect comparable features and reuse their architecture, components, helpers, naming, validation, error handling and tests. Follow established repository patterns across frontend, backend, integrations and tooling; do not introduce a parallel approach merely because it is convenient or familiar.
- Use the existing tRPC routers and client hooks for application queries and mutations, with the established authentication and response conventions. Reserve standalone HTTP routes for integrations that require them, such as webhooks and scheduled jobs; SDK convenience alone is not a reason to bypass tRPC.
- Cron endpoints must call `authenticateCronRequest` from `@/server/utils/cron` before timers, database access or other work. Keep their existing timing locks; authentication does not replace scheduling or concurrency guards.
- If an existing pattern cannot meet a concrete requirement, verify the limitation, choose the smallest compatible extension and document why the exception is needed. When replacing an approach, migrate its callers and remove the obsolete implementation.

## Commands and environments

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `make test` | Vitest; real-SQL suites skip without explicit throwaway DB configuration |
| `make lint` | Biome |
| `make typecheck` | TypeScript |
| `make makemigrations` | Generate schema migrations |
| `make bun add [package]` | Add dependency |
| `make install` | Install with Bun |
| `make start PORT=<free-port>` | Start local dev in any worktree; reuse shared Docker services and link missing `app/.env` from an existing worktree |

SQL tests **truncate every table in the configured database**. Use only a throwaway DB; CI supplies one. Local dev-stack invocation:

```sh
TEST_MYSQL_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE=1 TEST_MYSQL_URL='mysql://root:placeholder@127.0.0.1:3307/tnr_test' make test
```

PlanetScale organization: `nano-mathias`. Production: `tnr` / `main-1`; development: `tnr` / `development`; separate AI deployment: `theninja-ai` / `main`.

For local servers, disposable test users, authenticated tRPC calls and browser login, follow `.agents/skills/tnr-dev-server/SKILL.md`.

Create/edit shared skills only in `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. `make ensure-skills` (automatic with `make bun`) symlinks them into gitignored `.claude/skills/`; do not edit those copies.

## Code map

Next.js 15 App Router / React 19 / strict TypeScript; Tailwind, Shadcn/Radix; Drizzle/MySQL; tRPC; Clerk; Jotai; Three.js / React Three Fiber.

| Path | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `app/src/app/` | Routes; `manual/` is admin content management |
| `app/src/server/api/` | `root.ts`: router registry; `trpc.ts`: middleware and `baseServerResponse`; `routers/`: endpoints |
| `app/src/libs/` | Game logic by feature (combat, travel, bounty, etc.) |
| `app/src/validators/` | Shared Zod schemas |
| `app/src/layout/` | Reusable game UI; prefer existing components |
| `app/drizzle/` | `schema.ts`, `constants.ts`, `migrations/` |
| `app/src/utils/permissions.ts` | Centralized permissions |
| `app/src/utils/time.ts` | All new time utilities; check for existing helpers first |

Combat logic lives in `app/src/libs/combat/`: `actions.ts` (actions), `process.ts` (rounds/effects), `tags.ts` (effects), `types.ts` (battle state), `util.ts`, `database.ts`, `ai_v2.ts` (rules), `drawing.ts` (rendering). Tag schemas: `validators/combat.ts`; `initiateBattle` / `performAction`: `server/api/routers/combat.ts` (both under `app/src/`).

## Database and tRPC

- For expected mutation rejections (unsupported client, changed account, unmet prerequisites), return `errorResponse(message)` and stop before side effects. Follow the existing response contract instead of throwing `serverError` for normal user-facing outcomes. The frontend must display the message near the action, clear pending state and allow recovery without treating failure as success. Keep authentication/authorization middleware and schema validation enforced; unexpected exceptions remain errors.
- Prefer Drizzle query syntax over raw SQL. Endpoint shape: parallel queries → guards → mutations. Reuse existing endpoints/patterns; mutations typically return `baseServerResponse`. Keep DB convenience helpers at the bottom of their router (e.g. profile's `fetchUser`).
- Prefer a single guarded update over a transaction. Transactions are supported, but the PlanetScale serverless driver serializes statements through a session token; `Promise.all` does not remove those round-trips. Use a short transaction only when multiple rows must change together and one guarded statement cannot express the invariant.
- For a race confined to the same account with a reversible, support-removable outcome (e.g. a stray device row), prefer readable check-then-write and comment the race's cost. See `register.ts` / `push.ts`. **Do not add transactions or `FOR UPDATE` for these races**: missing-row locking reads can gap-lock and deadlock. Irreversible or cross-user costs still require atomic guards (see `purchases/grant.ts`).
- Handle deadlocks in safely restartable work with `retryOnDeadlock` from `@/server/utils/mysqlErrors`, not additional locks; even single statements can deadlock on index order.
- CAS references: `raids.ts` reward JSON guards, `activityStreak.ts` `lastClaimDate`, and `@/server/utils/concurrency.ts` (`claimUserSnapshot`, `consumeUserItemAtomically`). For concurrent counter grants use SQL increments such as `` sql`${userData.money} + ${delta}` ``; see token/point increments in `updateRewards`.
- `tournament.getTournament` must await `syncTournamentState` before loading data: the read intentionally advances brackets and pays finals. **Keep it off HTTP edge caches**; authenticated tRPC POST batching is fine.

## Native apps

Capacitor shells and dependencies live in `mobile/`, with their own `package.json`; see `mobile/README.md` for setup.

- `app/src/libs/native/` is the **only shell bridge**. Do not import `@capacitor/*` or raw `bridge` elsewhere under `src/` (Biome enforces this). Install plugins in `mobile/`, not `app/`, and add a wrapper in `libs/native/`.
- Fire-and-forget exports (`haptics`, `widgets`, `audioSession`, `liveActivity`) no-op off device; no platform check needed. Result-bearing calls (`appleAuth.authorize`, `oauthBrowser.open`, `purchases.purchase`, `push.register`) reject off device; call only after establishing shell context.
- Ordinary push must use `sendPushToUsers` from `@/server/utils/push`, never router-to-transport calls. It handles opt-outs, device fan-out and dead-token pruning, and never throws. Live Activities use `pushActivityUpdate` instead (ActivityKit tokens); defer with `after()` as in `hospital.ts` to keep Apple latency off the response.
- `Notification` is a global announcement feed: `userId` is the author; `unreadNotifications` increments determine recipients. It is separate from per-user push delivery.
- Store branching is client-side via `useNativeShell()`: `points/page.tsx` renders `NativeStore` instead of PayPal in the shell. Preserve this gate against web checkout. `libs/native/userAgent.ts` has a tested server-side detector, and the account-deletion router uses it to restrict the supported client.

## Code and UI conventions

- Use functional/declarative TypeScript, avoid classes, prefer named component exports and descriptive names (auxiliary verbs for booleans).
- File order: exported component → subcomponents → helpers → types.
- Comments explain purpose, not review history; remove markers such as "Issue X:" or "TODO from review:".
- Display game values using `@/drizzle/constants.ts`; never hardcode costs, thresholds or damage values.
- Prefer reusable `app/src/layout/` components and Shadcn/Radix; use mobile-first Tailwind and optimize Web Vitals.
- Sentry filtering lives in `app/instrumentation-client.ts`; inspect `app/src/app/_trpc/Provider.tsx` for existing toast handling and `isReplicateApiError` for a documented UX example. Third-party, network, extension or hydration errors are not automatically safe to ignore; apply the required UX checks above.
