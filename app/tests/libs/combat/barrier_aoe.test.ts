/**
 * Regression test for the AOE-vs-barrier damage scaling bug.
 *
 * `damageBarrier` consumes `barrierAbsorb` as a 0-1 fraction. The single-target
 * path supplies that fraction (getBarriersBetween normalizes absorbPercentage to
 * `value / 100`), but the AOE path used to assign the raw 1-100 `absorbPercentage`
 * integer directly. That made AOE hits deal ~100x the intended damage to barriers,
 * instantly destroying them. This test pins the AOE path to the fractional contract.
