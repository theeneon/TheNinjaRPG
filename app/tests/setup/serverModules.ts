/**
 * Registered via bunfig.toml, ahead of every suite.
 *
 * bun keeps one module registry for the whole run, so a `vi.mock` in any file replaces that
 * module for every other file too. When a suite stubbed `@/routers/profile` so it could run
 * without a database, every other suite silently inherited a `fetchUser` returning undefined
 * -- fatal for anything driving a real tRPC router, because the first guard then rejects.
 *
 * The stub lives here instead: registered once, and delegating to the real implementation
 * until a suite asks for something else. Suites opt in with `stubProfile` and hand the module
 * back with `resetServerModuleStubs`, so nothing leaks to the suites that never asked.
