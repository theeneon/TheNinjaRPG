 * next/image cannot emit a srcSet while images.unoptimized is set, so the renditions are
 * selected here with <picture> media queries and produced by Bunny's optimizer.
 *
 * Two renditions, not three: Bunny re-encodes at quality 85, above what these files were
 * authored at, so a rendition narrower than the source is larger than the source itself
 * (fall: 137,670 B at width=1280, worst at 143,442 B at width=1342, against 94,994 B
 * untouched). Bunny passes the original through once the requested width reaches the
 * source width, so `full` has to stay at or above the widest source — currently 1343px,
 * except summer at 1594px and Horizon at 1792px. An intermediate tablet width sits below that cliff by
 * definition and costs bytes and resolution at once.

/**
 * The same two renditions the <picture> below selects between, as preload hints.
 *
 * The wallpaper is the largest contentful paint on most pages, and marking it eager and
 * high priority only reorders it against other work the browser has already found -- the
 * browser cannot start it until the parser reaches the body. Search Console reported
 * every LCP group at 4.0s, so the fetch is moved into <head>.
 *
 * Both queries are written from one breakpoint, the second as the exact complement of the
 * first, so they cannot overlap (which would preload an image the page never shows) and
 * cannot leave a gap (which would leave a viewport with no preload at all). Spelling the
 * second bound out as a number instead would do both at fractional viewport widths, which
 * occur under browser zoom and on some devices.
