            current political parties and politicians), religiously demeaning, and
            sexually explicit content, and references to widely illegal drugs or guns

        <h3 className="pt-3 font-bold text-md">&nbsp;&nbsp;4.1 Overview</h3>
        <p className="my-2">
          &nbsp;&nbsp;Strikes do not reset and remain permanently attached to a user’s
          record. Moderators typically issue one official warning before applying a
          strike, unless the violation is severe. A moderator may issue an unofficial
          warning or rule reminder before issuing a strike or official warning. However,
          it is considered a courtesy and is not required before official action is
          taken.
        </p>

        <h3 className="pt-3 font-bold text-md">&nbsp;&nbsp;4.2 Strike Levels</h3>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5">
          <li>
            <b>Strike 1:</b> 24-hour Silence.
          </li>

            <b>Strike 3:</b> 1-week Silence
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Strike 4:</b> 1-month Silence. Appeals are allowed but rarely granted
            without substantial proof of error.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Escalation:</b> Violations beyond 4 strikes may lead to a permanent
            Silence or Ban.

        </ul>

        <h3 className="pt-3 font-bold text-md">
          &nbsp;&nbsp;4.3 Special Punishment Rules
        </h3>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5">
          <li>
            <b>Minimum Duration:</b> Silences under 24 hours are not considered strikes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Bans:</b> Bans count as 2 strikes. A 3rd ban could lead to a permanent
            ban.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Immediate Action:</b> Severe violations (e.g., hate speech, threats,
            doxxing, sexual harassment) may result in immediate silences or bans,
            possibly permanent.
          </li>
          <li>
            Abuse of bugs and game play mechanics will result in a ban instead of a
            silence. Game abuse will not be tolerated. Users may not be given a warning
            if the abuse is believed to be intentional.
          </li>
          <li>
            Strikes for punishments that have been completed may be removed, under
            review, after a year of good behaviour. However removal is not guaranteed.

            reporting user.
          </li>
          <li>
            Screenshots and grabs may be submitted as evidence however the use of them
            is at the discretion of the moderation staff and may be dismissed due to the
            ability to alter images. Users are encouraged to use the official reporting
            feature as it is the most reliable evidence.

        <ul className="list-disc pl-5">
          <li>
            Users may appeal disciplinary actions by contacting the issuing Moderator or
            Head Moderator.
          </li>
          <li>
            Appeals require substantial evidence and are rarely granted for permanent

          &nbsp;&nbsp;Staff may not use staff powers, tools, or influence (including
          moderation actions, content and balance changes, reward or item grants, and
          access to private information) in any matter where they have a conflict of
          interest. A conflict of interest exists whenever the matter involves:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5">
          <li>
            <b>Their Own Accounts:</b> Any account they own, control, have ever shared,
            or play on, including secondary accounts (alts), whether or not the account
            is currently active.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Connected Players:</b> Accounts belonging to family members, people in
            the same household or on the same IP, or anyone whose account they have
            access to.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Their Village, Clan, or Faction:</b> The village, clan, ANBU squad,
            faction, or any other group the staff member (or any of their accounts)
            belongs to or has belonged to within the last 30 days.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Players in Conflict:</b> Any player they are, or have recently been, in a
            personal dispute, argument, feud, or in-game rivalry with, and any player
            who has reported them or whom they have reported.

        <ul className="list-disc pl-5">
          <li>
            Not act on the matter themselves, and hand it to an unconflicted staff
            member in the same area (moderation or content) with the same or higher
            role. If no such staff member is available, escalate to the relevant Admin
            (Moderator Admin or Content Admin) or, failing that, the Site Owner.
          </li>
          <li>
            Disclose the conflict when handing it over, so the reviewing staff member
            has full context.
          </li>
          <li>
            Treat any doubt as a conflict. If a staff member is unsure whether a

            Moderator Admin, or Content Admin.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="my-2">
          &nbsp;&nbsp;These rules are applied by their intent, not only their wording.
          Actions that benefit a staff member&apos;s own accounts or groups indirectly
          (for example, a balance change made to favor their own build, or asking
          another staff member to act on their behalf) are treated as violations.

          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Report:</b> Use the in-game report feature so reliable evidence is

          <li>
            Staff may be placed on probation when joining or changing role, or after a

        <h3 className="pt-3 font-bold text-md">&nbsp;&nbsp;10.1 Impersonation</h3>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5">
          <li>
            Impersonating accounts, staff, or players (including past users) is
            prohibited and may result in permanent bans.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 className="pt-3 font-bold text-md">&nbsp;&nbsp;10.2 Language Policy</h3>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5">
          <li>
            TNR is an English-only game. Short phrases in other languages are allowed,
            but persistent use is not permitted to ensure moderation efficiency.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 className="pt-3 font-bold text-md">
          &nbsp;&nbsp;10.3 Criticism of Moderator Decisions
        </h3>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5">
          <li>
            Publicly criticizing moderation decisions or making unfounded assumptions
            about punishments is prohibited. Moderators often have access to additional
            context not available to players.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 className="pt-3 font-bold text-md">
          &nbsp;&nbsp;10.4 Selling Reputation Points
        </h3>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5">
          <li>
            Players may buy reputation points through the official store or trade with
            other players on the black market for in-game ryo. Buying or selling
            reputation points between players for real-world currency, or advertising
            such trades, is prohibited and may result in a warning or ban.

        <h2 className="font-bold text-lg">11. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
        <p className="my-2">
          TNR is provided on an &quot;as-is&quot; basis. Players use the platform at
          their own risk
        </p>
        <hr className="my-2" />

        <h2 className="font-bold text-lg">12. Modification of Terms</h2>
        <p className="my-2">
          TNR reserves the right to modify these rules at any time. Announcements will
          be made in-game and on official platforms.
        </p>
        <hr className="my-2" />

        <h2 className="font-bold text-lg">13. Discord</h2>
        <p className="my-2">
          Discord is used as an official means of communication for TNR and the TNR
          community. Bug and moderation tickets can be submitted there as an official
          channel. However for moderation issues the in-game report feature is
          encouraged to create reliable in-game evidence in addition to a moderation
          ticket if one is submitted. Updates and game changes may be posted in Discord
          in addition to in-game.
        </p>

        <h3 className="pt-3 font-bold text-md">&nbsp;&nbsp;13.1 Rules</h3>
        <p className="my-2">
          &nbsp;&nbsp;The TNR discord generally follows rules of the TNR website, but
          may have additional rules in place in a separate rule channel. It also follows
          the official Discord ToS. It is important to familiarize yourself with both
          sets of the rules. Strikes on discord are considered separate from strikes
          in-game, except for rare or extreme circumstances. Therefore a person may be
          banned or removed from the discord but be allowed to remain in-game.
          Individuals considered exceptionally disruptive to the TNR discord community
          may be removed, as discord is considered non essential for gameplay.
        </p>

        <h3 className="pt-3 font-bold text-md">&nbsp;&nbsp;13.2 External Discords</h3>
        <p className="my-2">
          &nbsp;&nbsp;Any discord besides the main TNR server is considered unofficial,
          regardless of whether it is run by a staff member or player, and is not
          required to follow the official TNR rules. These servers are joined at the
          risk of the player and are not the responsibility of TNR. Except when evidence
          of in-game infractions (such as botting, account sharing, exploitation etc.)
          or extreme, potentially criminal, circumstances (stalking, doxxing etc.)
          official action will not be taken against a player for behaviour within those
          servers. If users are experiencing negativity, harassment or disruptions
          within these servers, they are encouraged to leave them.
        </p>

        <h3 className="pt-3 font-bold text-md">&nbsp;&nbsp;13.2.1 Staff</h3>
        <p className="my-2">
          &nbsp;&nbsp;Staff may create, moderate, or participate in external discords.
          While action in these discords are not considered official staff actions,
          staff are still expected to remain reasonably professional as a reflection of
          the community they work for.
