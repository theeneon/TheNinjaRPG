/**
 * Low-level access to the Capacitor bridge.
 *
 * The native shell loads the production origin in a WKWebView / Android WebView and injects
 * `window.Capacitor` before page scripts run. The web bundle therefore talks to the bridge
 * through this module instead of depending on `@capacitor/*`: those packages are installed
 * in `mobile/package.json`, which is where `cap sync` has to find them to build the native
 * projects, and a second copy here would only give the two a chance to drift apart.
 *
 * Nothing outside `libs/native/` should import this file — see the `useNative*` hooks and
 * the feature modules alongside it for the call-site API.
